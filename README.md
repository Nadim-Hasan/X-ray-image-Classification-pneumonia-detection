hest X-ray Pneumonia Detection
A deep learning project for classifying chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories using convolutional neural networks.

Project Overview
This project uses a Kaggle dataset of chest X-ray images to build a classification model that can detect pneumonia from X-ray scans. The dataset contains 5,856 validated X-ray images categorized into two classes: Normal and Pneumonia.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:

Dataset Name: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
